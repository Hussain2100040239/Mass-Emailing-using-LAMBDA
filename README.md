 
Mass Emailing using AWS Lambda & SES

Mass emailing is a common requirement for businesses, organizations, and individuals alike. However, sending a large number of emails manually can be time-consuming and error-prone. One way to automate this process is by using Amazon Web Services:




 1)AWS Lambda-AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers
 2)CloudWatch-CloudWatch is a monitoring service that provides data and actionable insights for AWS resources
3)IAM Role- IAM (Identity and Access Management) is a service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources
4)Simple Email Service (SES)- IAM (Identity and Access Management) is a service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources
In this article, we will discuss how to use these services to create a mass emailing solution.


Step 1: Creating IAM Role
•	In the AWS console search for IAM in the search bar and select the service
•	In that select roles and click on Create role
•	Select use cases as Lambda and click on next
•	In permission, policies choose CloudWatch full access and SES full access and then click on next
•	Give a suitable name for the role and click on Create role
•	The role will be created.
 
 
Step 2: Creating Lambda Function
•	In the AWS console search for Lambda in the search bar and select the service.
•	Provide the name of the function.
•	In the position of runtime, we must choose the language that we want. Here, I am choosing the most recent NodeJS 16.x version.
•	Choose whether to create a new or existing role as the executing role in the following step. I’m choosing the role that I already created in the previous phase.
•	Rest everything. We can keep it optional
•	Select Create a Function.
 
 
•	After the creation of the lambda function, we need to write Lambda code to send an email
•	Next, choose to configure a test event
•	Give a suitable name for the test event and click on create
 
 
Step 3: Creating CloudWatch Events
•	In the AWS console search for CloudWatch in the search bar and select the service.
•	In the left navigation pane, select Event in that select rules and then click on create rule.
•	Next, choose the schedule and click on the Cron expression to set it to a specific time.
•	Select add target and choose the lambda function I’m choosing the function that I already created in the previous phase.
•	Click on configure details.
•	Next, give a name to the rule and rest everything we can keep optional
•	Click on Create the rule.
 
 
Result:
•	Lambda is triggered and sent an email to the users at the scheduled time
 
Conclusion:
In concluding this article, using AWS Lambda, IAM role, CloudWatch, and SES can be an efficient and reliable way to send mass emails. Lambda can be used to execute code that triggers email sending, while IAM roles can provide the necessary permissions to access SES. CloudWatch can be used to monitor and log the email-sending process, ensuring its successful completion. SES can be used to send bulk emails while providing features like email validation, suppression lists, and bounce handling. Overall, using these services in conjunction can provide a scalable and cost-effective solution for sending mass emails.
